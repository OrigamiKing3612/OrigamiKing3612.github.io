# **OrigamiKings Robotics Mod**

This mod is just for adding robot armor. The robot armor is the same as diamond armor.

**If you would like to help code make a pull request or issue on my [Github page](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod). If you can please help. Please do not make any Armor but you can suggest new ones in [issues](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod/issues).**

## Addons
You can download addons in-game by doing the command `orm-download-addon-(addon name)`. The mod will download the addon and tell you to restart your game.
